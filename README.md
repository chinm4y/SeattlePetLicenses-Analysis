# Seattle Pet Licenses Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the Seattle Pet Licenses dataset to uncover insights into pet ownership trends, license compliance, and other relevant findings. The analysis journey traverses through data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, employing a suite of tools including Alteryx for preprocessing and both Tableau and PowerBI for visualization.

## Data Source

The dataset was provided for academic purposes and is based on real-world data from Seattle's pet licensing system. For similar datasets, you might check out public data repositories or Seattle's official data portal.

## Tools Used

- **Alteryx:** Used for data cleansing, transformation, and preparation.
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):** For database management and query execution.
- **Tableau & PowerBI:** Employed for creating insightful visualizations and dashboards to analyze the data.

## Key Findings

1. **Service Request Trends:** Identified trends in pet license requests over time, highlighting seasonal variations and overall growth patterns.
2. **Source of Requests:** Analyzed the mediums through which pet licenses were requested, revealing a preference for digital over traditional methods.
3. **Departmental Workloads:** Examined the volume of service requests handled by different departments, identifying areas with higher workloads and response times.

## Challenges Encountered

- The dataset contained numerous null values and inconsistencies in data types.
- Dates were formatted as strings, necessitating conversion for analysis.
- The presence of 'Name not Defined' fields required careful handling to ensure accurate visualization and analysis outcomes.
